[![Moove It](https://circleci.com/gh/moove-it/react-native-template.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/moove-it/react-native-template?branch=master)

Welcome to Invoice machine repository. This project aims to create a cross platform app on both iOS and Android that can connect to printer and print out receipt according to user desire

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js >= 20.2.0](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Base dependencies

- [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [react-native-testing-library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) for testing.
- [@pipechela/tp-react-native-bluetooth-printer]

## Usage
___
#### Connect to Bluetooth ???

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `MainScreen.js`: This is the main screen when you first load the app

- `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Setup environments
---
### Using scripts from console

The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new `envs` you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure `yarn [platform]: [environment]`


DEV: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

STG: `yarn ios:staging` or `yarn android:staging`

PROD: `yarn ios:prod` o `yarn android:prod`

Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: `npm run ios:staging`

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (`.env.development`, `.env.production` and `.env.staging`)


#### Android

A map associating builds with env files is already defined in `app/build.gradle` you can modify or add environments if needed.

For multiple enviroments to work you would need to change `-keep class [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].BuildConfig { *; }` on `proguard-rules.pro` file.

#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

To create a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "qa"
- Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

  Expand the "Build" tab on the left menu
  - Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
  - Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type: `echo ".env.qa" > /tmp/envfile` replacing `.env.qa` with your file.
- Also, you will need to select the executable for the new schema:

  Expand the "Run" tab on the left menu
  - Under the "Executable" dropdown select the ".app" you would like to use for that schema


## Generate production version

These are the steps to generate `.apk`, `.aab` and `.ipa` files

### Android

1. Generate an upload key
2. Setting up gradle variables
3. Go to the android folder
4. Execute `./gradlew assemble[Env][BuildType]`

Note: You have three options to execute the project
`assemble:` Generates an apk that you can share with others.
`install:` When you want to test a release build on a connected device.
`bundle:` When you are uploading the app to the Play Store.

### iOS

1. Go to the Xcode
2. Select the schema
3. Select 'Any iOS device' as target
4. Product -> Archive

## Styleguide

For coding styling, we decided to go with ESLint and [React Native community's styleguide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-native-community#readme).
